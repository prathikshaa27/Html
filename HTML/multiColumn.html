    <p>Humanity has studied space since antiquity, when people first looked up and observed the wonders of the cosmos. Today, we send rockets, astronauts and probes into the solar system and beyond. Our expert coverage includes the latest updates on NASA, the James Webb Space Telescope, and firms like SpaceX, making it the ultimate resource for space enthusiasts. </p>
    <p>Galilean and Cartesian theories about space, matter, and motion are at the foundation of the Scientific Revolution, which is understood to have culminated with the publication of Newton's Principia Mathematica in 1687.[6] Newton's theories about space and time helped him explain the movement of objects</p>
    <p>Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on observation and experimentation. For a relationist there can be no real difference between inertial motion, in which the object travels with constant velocity, and non-inertial motion, </p>
    <p>In the eighteenth century the German philosopher Immanuel Kant developed a theory of knowledge in which knowledge about space can be both a priori and synthetic.</p>
    <p>In 1905, Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity, which led to the concept that space and time can be viewed as a single construct known as spacetime. In this theory, the speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observersâ€”which has the result that two events that appear simultaneous to one particular observer will not be simultaneous to another observer if</p>
