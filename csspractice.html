            <h1>River Ganga</h1>

        
        <p>Rainfall in the Ganges River basin varies from an average of 30 inches (76 centimeters) annually at the western end to more than 90 inches (229 centimeters) at the eastern end. The water supply of the Ganges system depends partly on the rains brought by the monsoon winds from July to October. Melting Himalayan snows in the hot season, from April to June, also contribute to the water supply. Heavy monsoon rains often cause the Ganges to overflow its banks, and the resulting floods can be deadly, especially in the delta region. The delta also experiences strong cyclones both before the start of the monsoon season, from March to May, and at the end of it, from September to October. In 1970 a catastrophic cyclone killed at least 200,000 and possibly as many as 500,000 people; another, in 1991, killed some 140,000 people.</p>


        <p>The Ganges basin is one of the most densely populated agricultural regions in the world. Most of the original natural vegetation and wild animals have disappeared, and the fertile plains are now heavily cultivated to meet the needs of the large population</p>

        <p>Use of the Ganges water for irrigation, either when the river floods or by means of gravity canals, has been common since early times. Irrigation has increased the production of such food and cash crops as wheat, sugarcane, cotton, and oilseeds.</p>
